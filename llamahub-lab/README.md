# OpenAI Laboratory - llama-hub work

- A repository to hold explorations and experiments with using OpenAI
  with the llama-hub PyPi modules.  
  <https://github.com/emptycrown/llama-hub>  
  
- A good practice is to activate the `venv` environment and `pip
  install -U llama-hub` frequently (at least every day)

- We try to keep the lab bench clean, but there is always the chance that unfinished work is left lying around.  Also, there is no guarantee that what is here today will be here tomorrow.
