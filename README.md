# OpenAI Laboratory

- A repository to hold explorations and experiments with using OpenAI.

- We try to keep the labs and benches clean, but there is always a chance that unfinished work is left lying around.  Also, there is no guarantee that what is here today will be here tomorrow.

- Comments and bug reports are welcome at <https://github.com/band/openaiLab/issues>, and I'm happy to review pull requests.

## Working practices:  
 - Each folder contains its own Python `venv` directory. My working
   practice is to activate a virtual environment  
   (`$ source venv/bin/activate`)  
   in each folder before running any code and deactivating when done.
