  PETER M. NEWTON AND DANIEL J. LEVINSON
  PSYCHIATRY, Vol 36, May 1973, pp. 115-142,

  - Notes by William L. Anderson, circa 1995

## TASK: primary and secondary task definitions

  PRIMARY TASK: “the task which the group or organization must achieve at
  some significant level if it is to survive.”

  SECONDARY TASKS: "often ... stand in a support or maintenance
  relationship to the primary task.”

## SOCIAL STRUCTURE:

  1. division of labor:  how the total work of a social system is distributed
  among its component parts

  2. division of authority: patterning of subordination within the organization

  3. boundaries: defined by the division of labor; responsibility for regulating
  boundaries is defined by the division of authority

## CULTURE:
  “values, assumptions, and beliefs which characterize a given social system
   and which are interrelated over time with the system’s social structure.”

## SOCIAL PROCESS:

  1. “imagery, fantasies, and feelings, nonrational and irrational which
  characterize collective life”

  2. What methodology (or technology) does the group employ to accomplish
  its task and what is the tempo of the work --  continuous ... or alternating
  brief periods of intense activity and long periods of quiescence?”
