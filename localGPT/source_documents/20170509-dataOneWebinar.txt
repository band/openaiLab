“The Challenges of Reproducibility In Data Scarce Fields”
Christine Borgman, Peter Darch

Chris Borgman
Range of data-sharing policies
 - most policies focus on sharing over re-use

Why share (current rationales)
 - reproduce research
 - make public assets available to all
 - leverage research investment
 - advance research & innovation

Why reuse research data?
 - reproduce research
 - replicate
 - verify or validate
 - integrate with other data

Documenting data for temperature

Data are representations of observations, objects, or other entities
used as evidience of pehon for the purposes of research or scholarchip

if data sharing is the answer, what is the question?
 - new models of scientific practice
Qualitative methods: document analysis, ethnography, interviews

[[ no guarantee of sci paradigm change ]]

Peter Darch
Reproducibility in the deep subseafloor biosphere

Reproducing an analysis requires access to
- data
- methods
- source code
[[ source code req'd or is the same binary program, procedure, or app enough? ]]
- workflows
Access means
- availability
- usability
- interpretability

- transition from discovery-driven to hypothesis-driven science

reproducibility objective is not the same as reuse objective

a new domain requires personal ties to become established
- reproducibility goals may inhibit sci progress in data-scare domains
- focus on repro may obscure data reuse opportunities

====
Infrastructure investments req'd. [[ where will the resources come from? ]]

Scarcity vs. abundance influences sharing behavior and moratoria.

Quality and trust: not in the data, but in the people and institutions
