Samuel P. Huntington. The Clash of Civilizations and the Re- making of
World Order. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1996.

In the summer of 1993, an article by Samuel P. Huntington in Foreign
Affairs entitled "The Clash of Civilizations?" posed the question of
whether conflicts between civilizations would dominate the future of
world politics. That article garnered the largest response that
Foreign Affairs has had since the even more famous article of 1948 in
which "X" (actually George F. Kennan) advanced the containment
doctrine to deal with the Soviet Union.

Huntington, a Harvard University professor, has expanded his article
into a complex and well-reasoned book which analyzes key issues and
presents significant information. It includes:

• a discussion of the nature, identity and dynamics of civilization
  throughout history. He also categorizes and describes the major
  contemporary civilizations that make up the post-Cold War world:
  Sinic (Chinese), Japanese, Hindu, Islam, Western, Latin American,
  and African (possibly).
  
• A critique of the concept of "universal civilization." Huntington
  focuses on the role of modernization and westernization and shows
  how they do not necessarily go together, and that non-Western
  societies increasingly want to become modern but not Western.
  
• The dominance and decline of Western power. Huntington writes, "The
  West is overwhelmingly dominant now and will remain number one in
  terms of power and influence well into the twenty-first
  century. Gradual, inexorable, and fundamental changes, however, are
  also occurring in the balances of power among civilizations and the
  power of the West relative to that of other civilizations will
  continue to decline."
    
• The resurgence of non-Western cultures, particularly those that have
  come from Asia and from Islam. Huntington explains how the
  population explosion in Muslim countries and the economic rise of
  East Asia challenges Western dominance, promotes opposition to
  supposedly "universal" Western ideals, and intensifies
  intercivilizational conflict over such issues as nuclear
  proliferation, immigration, human rights and democracy.
  
• A look at why the most dangerous clashes of the future are likely
  to arise "from the interaction of Western arrogance, Islamic
  intolerance,and Sinic assertiveness." Huntington revisits the
  Persian Gulf War, and the Soviet-Afghan War of 1979-89, which he
  describes as "transition wars" -- heralding an era dominated by
  ethnic conflict.
  
All the above notions and others in the book are subject to debate. I
recomment reading this book before you take sides.
