                        Today, greenhouse gas emissions are rising again while questions about how
                        to spur economic growth continue. I wonder, are we missing the connection?
                        Might a move away from reduction help us to understand our shared options?

                            natural resources and human labor. As our energy sources shifted from
                            timber to whale oil to coal to oil, the reward has been a vast array of
                            consumer options and, for many, better lives. The march of progress
                            continues: today people everywhere have access to more streaming

                            comes at a cost that consumers cannot easily see. Look about and you
                            will see signs of a gathering crisis of resource depletion and
                            pollution along with glimpses of its socio-economic

                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Shifts in thinking are visible. The
                            2008</span> <span><em>Journal</em></span> <span>story noted that the
                            economist and Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz had abandoned his formerly
                            cornucopian world view for a more Malthusian one. Markets alone cannot
                            solve resource and pollution problems, Stiglitz explained, when oil,
                            water, and other key resources are underpriced relative to their
                            environmental impact, especially given the extremely slim prospect that
                            people would accept the drastic changes needed to price them correctly.
                            But soon the specter of growth-limiting resource constraints and
                            skepticism that markets would handle them again retreated from the
                            news. It turned out that, for a moment, the world’s ecological
                            footprint lightened: 2009 saw the largest ever drop in fossil-fuel
                            greenhouse gas emissions, caused by the global financial collapse that
                            first gathered speed in 2007. Attention turned to the firms,
                            governments, and families who were struggling to survive the economic
                            crisis.</span> <span><a href=

                            deepen.</span></p>


                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>I wonder, are we missing the connection?
                            Could the forces that shaped the financial crisis be connected with the
                            challenges we face in climate, pollution, human rights, and economic
                            opportunity? Might a move away from reduction help us to understand our
                            shared options?Social and economic systems figure into the answers, no
                            matter what your philosophical leanings. But how, exactly, do we make
                            sense of these systems?</span>
                            </p>


                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Addressing the question, I argue, involves
                            working against reduction. To help us get there, let’s explore the
                            cybernetics underpinnings of the notion of limits to growth to map out
                            how the very ideas that have fueled technological and economic growth
                            could also enlighten our response to them. My hope is that we will find
                            signs that there is a better way.</span>

                            </h2>


                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Thomas Malthus, whose name has become
                            synonymous with the idea of limits to growth, posited that human
                            populations could grow exponentially while agriculture—the backbone of
                            the economy when he was writing in 1798—would grow only arithmetically.
                            While the notion of self-reinforcing exponential growth has roots in
                            ancient mathematics, formal approaches to logarithms had been developed
                            in the seventeenth century. The Malthus equations, which underpin
                            modern demography, explain how populations grow at accelerating rates
                            without constraint unless checked by a rise in mortality (famine,
                            disease, war) or by changes in human behavior (causing fertility rates
                            to reach or fall below replacement). While the first-order differential
                            equations produce smooth trajectories, Malthus understood that the
                            effects of the limits would appear sporadically, though famines and
                            plagues caused by crowding and poverty that would temporarily alleviate
                            some pressures. Malthus wondered if we would ever be able to escape “a
                            perpetual oscillation between happiness and misery.”</span><span class=

                            systems, systems modelers often start with the population growth model
                            proposed by Malthus. Its value lies not only in the intuitions that it
                            maps into, making differential equations meaningful to the audience
                            (and in the intuitions it challenges, when the exponential growth rate
                            is graphed and the surprising hockey-stick trajectory emerges) but also
                            in the thinking it sparks about strengths and limitations of the model,
                            as people wonder what else to factor in. In such a use, a model is not
                            just a computational machine to check the logical output of a set of
                            assumptions but is also a uniquely valuable tool for dialog because it
                            forces participants to surface their assumptions.</span>

                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>The interplay between self-fueling processes
                            of growth and the limiting forces of competition set the stage for
                            economists and biologists who followed Malthus and Darwin. The same
                            interplay found a parallel in control theory, an idea central to
                            mechanical and electrical systems built on the physicist James Clerk
                            Maxwell’s nineteenth century work on governing mechanisms for
                            regulating steam engines. The twentieth century saw the flowering of
                            electrical engineering, which began exploring how to use information
                            from sensors to dynamically guide the state of a machine using feedback
                            control, and cybernetics was born.</span>

                            psychology, urban studies, ecology, management, philosophy, and more.
                            Anthropologist Margaret Mead looked at family systems through the lens
                            of feedback, using her experience to argue in 1967 that cybernetics
                            should include itself in its mapping of systems, giving rise to
                            second-order cybernetics.</span><span class=

                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>A decade before Mead’s speech, electrical
                            engineer Jay Forrester founded the field of system dynamics, a feedback
                            modeling approach that uses state variables to model interactions among
                            people, nature, and technology. Like other threads of cybernetics it
                            was made possible by the new power of computers to simulate the
                            behavior of dynamically complex systems: after centuries of
                            mechanization enabled economies to become more complex while jobs
                            became more specialized, technology became a tool for moving beyond
                            reduction in how we think.</span>

                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Simplifying assumptions needed for
                            analytical tractability were no longer necessary: the world could be
                            cast as multicausal, simultaneous, and probabilistic, with forces for
                            change and stability playing out at varying scales. Human behavior,
                            with its panoply of explicit and implicit judgments, could be captured
                            with unprecedented realism, taking insights from a growing body of
                            experimental and field studies of human decision making. The study of
                            bounded rationality had been pioneered by economists who drew on
                            cybernetic thinking to build new theories of social and economic action
                            that continue to influence the behavioral turn in economics, policy,
                            and technology design today.</span>

                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Instead of relying on theoretical
                            simplifications of classical economics and closed analytical solutions,
                            researchers and policy designers began to map out potential pathways of
                            complex, interacting systems that captured the influence of multiple
                            factors, without needing to rely on mental simulation alone. This
                            approach, as Forrester explained to colleagues and students at MIT, was
                            built on philosophy as much as technology; instead of looking at events
                            and narrow slices of the world that assumed away everything else,
                            computers allowed analysts to embrace a continuous and holistic
                            perspective in which everything could connect in some way to everything
                            else—something that philosophers, artists, spiritual leaders, and wise
                            grandmothers have known for millennia could now be mapped

                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>The systems view reminds us that in the real
                            world, what we see as events are themselves the products of continuous
                            processes that unfold over time, with no beginning and end, and that
                            nothing is ever solely a cause or solely an effect. Events, cause,
                            effect, side-effect, externality, main variable: all are artefacts of
                            our thinking that we reify in ways that shape our perspectives in
                            unseen ways. When you take a new medicine, your pancreas and kidney do
                            not know which of its effects are intended and which are not, yet the
                            language we use—“side effects”—tends to downplay the unintended
                            consequences.</span>

                            comes from a simple plot of exponential growth: depending on the scale

                            of growth can look like a flat line or gentle slope—which in turn
                            shapes how you think about the situation and the options. It all
                            depends on your perspective, which is in turn is shaped by the
                            questions you are asking. The greatest shortcoming of the human race is
                            our inability to understand the exponential

                            reveals that swings into undesirable states can be corrected by
                            response mechanisms when the entire system is operating within a zone
                            of stability. This understanding precedes computer modeling, of course:
                            self-correction underpins the design of democracy, markets, and our
                            other core social institutions. But history teaches us that some forays
                            can take the system into an unrecoverable state, as the Easter
                            Island/Rapa Nui example of an island civilization’s collapse reveals.
                            Feedback can come too late to rescue you. Across every tradition, our
                            songs and literature convey these truths. The twin stories of rebalance

                            overshooting the stable zone? We’ve already heard that economists are
                            skeptical that prices for natural resources could be reset globally to
                            reflect their true cost to the planet, but there are plenty of examples
                            of countries imposing higher taxes or limiting carbon emissions via
                            permits and auctions. Such reforms enable markets to move towards
                            greater sustainability. Another solution is to create markets in

                            power usage). Systems thinkers caution that such methods push back one

                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Perhaps the problem is simply that we’re not
                            there yet, that around the corner is some future, post the hockey-stick
                            transition, where technology will automatically unlock benefits for the
                            poor. Such thinking is a common trap in future studies: that tomorrow
                            will somehow be radically different from today, that the complexities
                            and challenges we now face will be transformed. Might the event-based
                            thinking that early cyberneticists took on in advocating for a
                            continuous feedback view be to blame for such naïveté? Today and
                            tomorrow are linked by myriad interactions. Any picture of a radically
                            different future will need to explain how we get there, and acknowledge
                            that things will keep changing.</span>
                            </p>


                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>With my skepticism in mind, it seems that we
                            need more than just technology: we need ways to think, decide, and
                            create together. In predictably bureaucratic language, the World Bank
                            study identifies the antidotes to technology’s failure: reforms in the
                            business environment, skills development, and good governance.</span>
                            </p>


                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Can we cast these ideas in a creative,
                            generative, and hopeful light?</span>
                            </p>


                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Because it’s impossible to get things right
                            the first time, and because the future is both already unfolding and at
                            the same time always ahead on the horizon, we need to build the
                            dialogs, institutions, interactions, and collaborations that will
                            enable us to reform and redesign how we live, learning from our own
                            experience and others as we go, missteps and failures included.</span>
                            </p>


                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>There is no “there” there when it comes to
                            the future, so what we now need is a way to improve the journey.</span>
                            </p>


                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>What if we could redirect some of the effort
                            that we currently devote to developing technology and business to new
                            ways of working and living together? Cities, schools, neighborhoods,
                            and companies could replace machines of blood and flesh with
                            responsive, participatory, creative, and generative social organisms by
                            harnessing the best of technology and rejecting its ills. To do this,
                            we need a relentless, diligent, and clear-eyed ability to root out the
                            unwanted effects of technology and markets and a commitment to
                            nurturing the participation and creativity they unleash. Tech insiders
                            are helping us to think more wisely: “Don’t simply focus on what would
                            be ideal or critique the status quo,” danah boyd advises her fellow
                            technologists, “Genuinely examine how what you’re seeking could also be
                            corrupted and abused.”</span><span class=

                            <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Ito calls for a mindset change. This is the
                            response I imagine. We’d teach our children and each other to
                            understand the dangers the thought patterns built into the ways we look
                            at the world and take action today. Recognizing that good intentions
                            can unleash revenge effects, we’d learn to ask how things might go
                            wrong, using every method at our disposal to imagine both the upside
                            and the down side of our interventions. Grasping the lessons of tipping
                            points, we’d value resilience. Understanding that people and nature are
                            not separate, we would stretch our consciousness of everything around
                            us and work against narrow categorization. In exploring both the wonder
                            and danger in exponential growth, we’d value the principles, practices,
                            and investment in human systems that would enable wise choices about
                            how we interact with each other and the natural world. We’d move from a
                            sense of separation to what Martin Buber called “I-and-Thou.” Wiener’s
                            colleague Heinz von Forster used the same quote from Buber to lay out
                            what he saw as the most important ethical principle for second-order
                            cybernetics:</span>

He reframed the way we approach science and design. Marvin had a way of connecting with everyone, whether a child or an Institute Professor, a rock star, or a cook, in way that made us all feel smarter. To those of us who were lucky enough to be his students or colleagues (he made little distinction between the two) Marvin was like Jedi Master Yoda, an impish sage with an inner sense of truth. He challenged our foolish ideas without making us feel like fools. He pushed us across disciplinary boundaries, out of the comfort zones of academic study, into the realm of new ideas. Marvin had both an extraordinary imagination and an extraordinary intellectual generosity. He invited those around him to see the world in an unconventional way.

JoDS’ mission is to forge new connections between science and design, breaking down the barriers between traditional academic disciplines in the process. Our new issue looks at designing a complex and unknowable future with machines, questioning theories such as Singularity and modern economic and market-based decision making. What if the promise of AI is not a question of humans versus machines but one of intelligence augmentation in collaboration with machines? Can you envision a new approach to increase human flourishing informed by second-order cybernetics, systems dynamics, and complex systems that resists the dangerous reductionist paradigms we currently use?

The Malthus equations, which underpin modern demography, explain how populations grow at accelerating rates without constraint unless checked by a rise in mortality (famine, disease, war) or by changes in human behavior (causing fertility rates to reach or fall below replacement). While the first-order differential equations produce smooth trajectories, Malthus understood that the effects of the limits would appear sporadically, though famines and plagues caused by crowding and poverty that would temporarily alleviate some pressures.

Such reforms enable markets to move towards greater sustainability. Another solution is to create markets in avoided pollution (such as negawatts, which is energy that electric utilities do not have to generate because people are cutting back on power usage). Systems thinkers caution that such methods push back one set limits, buying us time, but if we do not manage other limits (water pollution, for example), becoming more efficient in one dimension may move the sum total of human activity towards a limiting constraint at an even faster clip.

Cities, schools, neighborhoods, and companies could replace machines of blood and flesh with responsive, participatory, creative, and generative social organisms by harnessing the best of technology and rejecting its ills. To do this, we need a relentless, diligent, and clear-eyed ability to root out the unwanted effects of technology and markets and a commitment to nurturing the participation and creativity they unleash.

This is the response I imagine. We’d teach our children and each other to understand the dangers the thought patterns built into the ways we look at the world and take action today. Recognizing that good intentions can unleash revenge effects, we’d learn to ask how things might go wrong, using every method at our disposal to imagine both the upside and the down side of our interventions. Grasping the lessons of tipping points, we’d value resilience. Understanding that people and nature are not separate, we would stretch our consciousness of everything around us and work against narrow categorization. In exploring both the wonder and danger in exponential growth, we’d value the principles, practices, and investment in human systems that would enable wise choices about how we interact with each other and the natural world. We’d move from a sense of separation to what Martin Buber called “I-and-Thou.” Wiener’s colleague Heinz von Forster used the same quote from Buber to lay out what he saw as the most important ethical principle for second-order cybernetics: &quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}]},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;blockquote&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;paragraph&quot;,&quot;attrs&quot;:{&quot;class&quot;:&quot;MsoNormal&quot;},&quot;content&quot;:[{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Contemplate the human with the human, and you will see the dynamic duality, the human essence, together: here is the giving and the receiving, here the aggressive and the defensive power, here the quality of searching and of responding, always both in one, mutually complementing in alternating action, demonstrating together what it is: human.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;footnote&quot;,&quot;attrs&quot;:{&quot;count&quot;:33,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; https://web.stanford.edu/group/SHR/4-2/text/foerster.html &quot;}}]}]},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;paragraph&quot;,&quot;attrs&quot;:{&quot;class&quot;:&quot;MsoNormal&quot;},&quot;content&quot;:[{&quot;text&quot;:&quot; It’s time to heed the advice of Weiner, von Forster, Mead, Forrester, and other founders of cybernetics, and put human connection back in the system.&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;text&quot;}]}]},&quot;collaborativeRef&quot;:null,&quot;pubId&quot;:&quot;97ff26fd-2d08-4a1d-aee5-e0f8c5d8e9a8&quot;,&quot;createdAt&quot;:&quot;2018-01-22T19:50:06.527Z&quot;,&quot;updatedAt&quot;:&quot;2018-01-22T19:50:06.527Z&quot;}],&quot;versionsList&quot;:[{&quot;createdAt&quot;:&quot;2018-01-22T17:22:21.290Z&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;e230f0f7-7741-4056-9973-e76c5356f226&quot;},{&quot;createdAt&quot;:&quot;2018-01-22T19:50:06.527Z&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ba40a020-ce9f-445d-9d81-14b470356dac&quot;}],&quot;citationData&quot;:{&quot;pub&quot;:{&quot;apa&quot;:&quot;&lt;div class=\&quot;csl-bib-body\&quot;&gt; &lt;div data-csl-entry-id=\&quot;97ff26fd-2d08-4a1d-aee5-e0f8c5d8e9a8\&quot; class=\&quot;csl-entry\&quot;&gt;Sastry, A.
